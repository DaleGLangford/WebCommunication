<h1> About Me: </h1>
<p> Hello, my name is Dale Langford. I am a professional archaeologist with over seven years experience working in commercial archaeology.
during this time I have had the opprotunity to work on project throughout Ontario (Canada), the United Kingdom, and the Republic of Ireland. 
This website has been designed to provide an overview of my archaeological career experience, as well as to highlight what I feel are some of the more unique
artefacts and adventures I have had. Please enjoy! </p>
