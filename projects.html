<h1 class = "title3"> GIS and Cartography:</h1>
<div class = "projects">
<img class="image2" src="images/VintageTopo.png" alt="Vintage Topographic map with DEM elevation" width="300">
<p class = projdesc> While I have dabbled in map making for several years, 2020 marked my first official steps into the world of GIS and cartography. 
	I am currently enrolled in the Cartographic Specialist program offered by Fleming College and have enjoyed every minute of it. Some of the projects 
	I have had the opportunity to work on include site suitability analyses, remote sensing image interpretation and analysis, and various cartographic 
	mapping projects. Outside of assigned schoolwork I have enjoyed completing online tutorials by other cartographers.</p>

<h1 class = "title3"> Archaeological Work in Ireland:</h1>
<div class = "projects">
<img class="image2" src="images/brooch.jpg" alt="Early christian semi-penannular silver brooch (Republic of Ireland)" width="300">
<p class = projdesc> One project that stands out for me during my time working the republic of Ireland was my participation on the N5 roadworks 
	project with Archaeological Management Solutions. This linear road works project resulted in the excavation of numerous archaeological sites 
	along the proposed impact alignment, including an Early Christian ring fort that I was fortunate to be a crew member on. While little remained 
	visible prior to excavations, the removal of topsoil revealed a large circular ditch with numerous internal pit features and a stone lined 
	souterrain feature. The Early Christian period in Ireland dates to between AD400 and AD1100. Some of the artefacts excavated included bone 
	needles, bone weaving tools, stone spindle whorls, knife blades, and a silver semi-penannular triskele designed brooch.</p>

<h1 class = "title3"> Archaeological Work in England:</h1>
<div class = "projects">
<img class="image2" src="images/mortaria.jpg" alt="Roman mortaria pottery (United Kingdom)" width="300">
<p class = projdesc> I was incredibly fortunate to work on several sites throughout England as both an experienced archaeologist and supervisor. 
	From multi-component Roman/Medieval sites on the coast of Suffolk, to Iron Age sites and Saxon in the midlands. My time working in England 
	was never dull â€“ even when the rain came down so fast in winter that you could barely bail your excavation before they had filled to the top 
	again with water. The final site I was able to participate on represented an expedient Roman pottery production site where the site was 
	littered with various pottery types, including mortarium pottery.</p>
